# NASA-API-Site
This is a site I made using NASA's public APIs. Specifically I used the APOD (astronomy picture of the day) and the NASA image 
library. 

Every day the APOD populates with a new picture with the photographer and an explanation of the dpicture below it.

The image search grabs whatever images in NASAs image library that realate to the search query. There is a button to scroll through
all of these pictures until you have reached the end.
